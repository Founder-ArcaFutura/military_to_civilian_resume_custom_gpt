# Agent Instructions

This project is intended to be a simple and straightforward data source for a custom GPT. Its primary purpose is to provide the GPT with the information it needs to translate military occupations into civilian equivalents.

Please keep the following in mind:

*   **Simplicity is key.** The goal is to provide a reliable and easy-to-use API, not to build a complex, all-encompassing system.
*   **Avoid over-engineering.** The backend should be as simple as possible while still meeting the needs of the custom GPT.
*   **Focus on the data.** The most important part of this project is the data. Ensure that the data is accurate and up-to-date.
